# A no-name WebGPU/ECS engine

## Why you shouldn't use this

This folder is named "Engine" and looks relatively standalone, right? As a result, you may be
tempted to use it in you own project.

_This would be a mistake._

This engine was built to both allow me to experiment with building an ECS (Entity Component System)
app and to give me a semi-reusable base to build WebGPU things on while the standard evolves, but
I have no plans to put any maintenance or development effort into it other than what I personally
find useful. Bugs filed against the engine that don't have a direct effect on the SpookyBall game
will be ignored.

With that in mind, feel free to reference or steal from this code as much as you'd like! It's my
hope that it proves to be helpful for developers building their own WebGPU-based software. I just
don't have the time to maintain a publically used 3D engine.
